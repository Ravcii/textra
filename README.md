# Textra

Textra is a simple and fast *****t*****ags *****extra*****ctor package that helps to work with structs tags.

Textra parses struct tags and returns them as a slice. It also does provide extra functionality like filtering.

Gathering json tags to feed it some other service is probably the most common usecase of this.

_Initially I built it for another private project, but decided to try open-source it, since it could be useful in some use-cases_

## Go Get

```shell
